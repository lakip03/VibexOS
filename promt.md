You are building a bare-metal operating system kernel (monolithic, C-based) without any standard C library. Write a primitive C library that includes:
üßæ Requirements

    printf() implementation:

        Self-contained ‚Äî no libc, stdlib, or stdio.

        Supports a minimal subset of format specifiers:

            %s ‚Äì strings

            %c ‚Äì characters

            %d or %i ‚Äì signed integers (base 10)

            %x ‚Äì hexadecimal integers (lowercase)

        Writes directly to the VGA text buffer at 0xB8000 in text mode.

        Supports newline (\n) handling (i.e., advances to the next row properly).

    Modular design:

        Implement printf() on top of a simpler function like putchar() or print_char() that writes a single character to the VGA buffer.

        Include helper functions for:

            Integer to ASCII conversion (decimal and hexadecimal)

            Cursor tracking (row/column)

            Basic screen scrolling (optional)

    Usage context:

        This library will be used within the kernel (kernel.c) after bootloading completes and protected mode is active.

        Written in C, compiled with gcc -m32.

    Output:

        File: /src/lib/printf.c (implementations)

        Header: /src/include/printf.h (declarations)

        Ensure header guards are present

        The implementation must be freestanding and suitable for a kernel.

    Example usage:

        Demonstrate calling printf("Welcome to VibexOS version %d\n", 1); from within your kernel_main().

üì¶ Output Should Include:

    src/lib/printf.c ‚Äì full implementation

    src/include/printf.h ‚Äì header with printf declaration

    Example call inside kernel.c

    Updated Makefile (optional): include -I src/include and compile printf.c into kernel binary.

Let me know if you'd like to expand the library with memory functions (memcpy, memset), string utils, or input handling next.

‚úÖ Prompt: Build a Basic Kernel Shell (Input + Echo) in C

You are writing a basic shell for your monolithic operating system kernel (VibexOS). Generate C code that provides:
üßæ Functional Requirements

    Input from keyboard:

        Read key presses from keyboard hardware via the keyboard interrupt (IRQ1).

        Decode scancodes into ASCII characters (handle lowercase letters, digits, and basic symbols).

        Store typed characters into a buffer in RAM (use a fixed-size char array).

    Display to screen:

        For every keypress, echo the character to screen via VGA text mode (write to 0xB8000).

        When Enter is pressed:

            Move to a new line.

            Print: You typed: <buffered string> (or similar response).

            Then clear the buffer and wait for next input.

    Environment:

        Written in C, compiled with gcc -m32, running after the bootloader.

        Assume protected mode is active.

        Keyboard interrupt handling should be set up via the IDT (Interrupt Descriptor Table).

    Constraints:

        Do not use libc or any OS features ‚Äî this is a freestanding kernel.

        Handle only printable ASCII characters and backspace (optional).

        Keep implementation modular (e.g., separate keyboard.c, shell.c, vga.c files).

üì¶ Output Should Include:

    src/kernel/shell.c ‚Äì core loop that handles input + echo

    src/drivers/keyboard.c ‚Äì ISR and buffer management

    src/drivers/vga.c ‚Äì VGA text-mode display helpers (optional if not already created)

    src/include/*.h ‚Äì headers for each module (with include guards)

    Example session:

    > hello world
    You typed: hello world
    >

    BONUS (Optional): Implement basic scrolling if VGA reaches bottom of screen.

‚öôÔ∏è Integration Notes

    Make sure your IDT is initialized and the IRQ1 interrupt handler is correctly set up.

    Remap the PIC if needed (IRQ1 = INT 0x21 or similar).

    The shell loop can run from kernel_main() after enabling interrupts (sti).
