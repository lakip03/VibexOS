# VibexOS 🌀
*Building an operating system in 14 days using only AI-generated code*

## The Challenge

**Can AI build a working operating system from scratch?**

This is a 14-day experiment to create VibexOS — a minimal but functional operating system where every single line of code is generated by AI through prompt engineering. No human-written assembly, C code, or system configuration allowed.

## Success Criteria (Day 14 Goal)

VibexOS will be considered successful when I can:

✅ **Boot with custom message** - See VibexOS boot screen  
✅ **Command shell** - Drop into a working command prompt  
✅ **File creation** - Type `edit hello.txt` and create files  
✅ **Text editing** - Write and modify text content  
✅ **File persistence** - Save files and read them back  
✅ **Basic navigation** - Browse a simple RAM-based filesystem  

**The ultimate test**: Can I create a text file, edit it, save it, and read it back — all through VibexOS commands?

## The AI-Only Rule

- **Zero human code** - Every line generated by ChatGPT/Claude
- **Pure prompt engineering** - Complex system built through conversation
- **No frameworks** - Raw assembly and C only
- **Real hardware constraints** - Must work on actual x86_64 architecture

## Current Architecture

```
VibexOS Target:
┌─────────────────┐
│   Bootloader    │ ← Custom boot message
│    (NASM)       │
├─────────────────┤
│   Kernel (C)    │ ← Memory management
│                 │
│ ┌─────────────┐ │
│ │    Shell    │ │ ← Command interpreter
│ └─────────────┘ │
│ ┌─────────────┐ │
│ │Text Editor  │ │ ← File creation/editing
│ └─────────────┘ │
│ ┌─────────────┐ │
│ │RAM FileSystem│ │ ← In-memory storage
│ └─────────────┘ │
└─────────────────┘
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Build VibexOS
make clean && make

# Test in QEMU
make run

# Expected output:
# VibexOS v1.0 - AI Generated Operating System
# Loading kernel...
# VibexOS> _
```

## Development Progress

**Week 1: Foundation**
- [x] Bootloader with custom message
- [x] Kernel initialization  
- [x] Basic memory setup
- [ ] Shell prompt implementation

**Week 2: User Experience**
- [ ] Command parser (`ls`, `edit`, `cat`)
- [ ] Simple text editor
- [ ] RAM-based file operations
- [ ] File save/load functionality

## The AI Workflow

### Prompt Strategy
1. **"Jhon" (ChatGPT)** - System architect  
   - Converts requirements → technical specs
   - Defines memory layouts and boot protocols
   - Creates detailed implementation prompts

2. **Claude** - Code generator  
   - Receives precise technical prompts
   - Generates bootloader assembly
   - Implements kernel and user programs

### Example Interaction
```
Human: "I need a bootloader that displays 'VibexOS Starting...' 
and loads a kernel at 0x8000"

AI: [Generates complete NASM bootloader with proper boot sector,
BIOS interrupts, and kernel loading sequence]
```

## Why This Matters

**For AI Development:**
- Tests LLM capabilities in low-level programming
- Explores prompt engineering for complex systems
- Demonstrates AI's potential in systems software

**For Operating Systems:**
- Proves minimal OS concepts still work
- Shows alternative development methodologies  
- Creates educational resource for OS fundamentals

## The Real Challenge

Building an OS isn't just about code — it's about:
- **Understanding hardware** (x86 boot process, memory management)
- **System integration** (bootloader → kernel → userspace)
- **Debugging without tools** (no printf, no debugger, just CPU states)
- **Prompt precision** (one wrong instruction crashes everything)

## Current Status

**Day [X] of 14**

🟢 Bootloader generates and assembles  
🟡 Kernel compiles but needs shell integration  
🔴 Text editor not yet implemented  
🔴 File operations pending  

## Follow Along

This experiment is documented in real-time:
- `prompt-history/` - Every AI conversation
- `build-logs/` - Compilation attempts and failures  
- `README-updates.md` - Daily progress tracking

## The Ultimate Question

*"If I can't write code, but I can write prompts that generate code... am I still programming?"*
